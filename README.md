**LittleKt Game Base**

This is a game base that I use for my personal projects. It contains a bunch of placeholders for things like asset
managment and scene handling as well as graphic related things like effects, a custom camera, level management, and the likes.

It uses `littlekt-extras` repo directly as a submodule.

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LeHaine/littlekt-game-base.git`
